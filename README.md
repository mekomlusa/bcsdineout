Project 1 for CSCE 608, Fall 2017. Provide basic information about restaurants in the Bryan/College Station/Houston area. (1k data points collected)

A working example is [here](https://mighty-lake-95591.herokuapp.com/catalog/).

A taste of Django. My goal is to have this under continuous development.
