Project 1 for CSCE 608, Fall 2017. Provide basic information about restaurants in the Bryan/College Station/Houston area. (1k data points collected)

A working example is [here](https://mighty-lake-95591.herokuapp.com/catalog/).

A taste of Django. My goal is to have this under continuous development.

# How to use it?
* Navigate to the [website](https://mighty-lake-95591.herokuapp.com/catalog/).
* Without logging in, you should be able to:
1. Use the restaurant picker on the homepage/up on the tool bar to have the system randomly picks a restaurant for you.
2. Search for a restaurant by name, category, or city by clicking the "Search" on the top left bar.
3. Browse all restaurants available by clicking "Details" > "All restaurants".
4. Browse all categories available and their associated restaurants by clicking "Details" > "All categories".


* You can create a new account by clicking "Have an account?" on the top right bar, or log in if previously registerd.

   Once logged in, the following features will be unlocked:

1. On a restaurant detail page, a registered user can mark a restaurant as favorite/remove favorite restaurant from the bookmark list.
2. On a restaurant detail page, a registered user can add a note to the restaurant if no note was previously created.
3. On a restaurant detail page, a registered user can update an existing note to the restaurant.
4. On a restaurant detail page, a registered user can delete an existing note to the restaurant.
5. A user can check how other users are exploring new restaurants by clicking the user name on the top right bar > "Community Status".
6. A user can reset password and log out.

# Any question??

Maybe send me an issue and I'll try to catch up ASAP :)
